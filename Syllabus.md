## Data Visualization Module 7-14 (7 weeks, 14 days)

The best journalism education has at least three components:
- A broad and solid liberal arts background
- Basic and fundamental journalism skills
- Preparation, principles and practice for the digital age

In Lehigh's journalism major, you get all three. 

From Fall 2016, the department started to introduce important, even exciting, additions to the curriculum. We have witnessed a growing need for journalism students to be familiar with data and to use data for visualization and storytelling. It will add to your education and set you apart on the job market.

Rather than have students take two more required classes, the department has found natural homes for both data journalism and data visualization. Jour 23 Editing and Critical Thinking will have 7 weeks of traditional editing and 7 weeks of data journalism. The class previously had instruction on working with numbers. Jour 24 Visual Communication will also have two modules, 7 weeks of study in photography, videography and print design and 7 weeks of study in data visualization. The class previously had just touched upon visualization.

You should treat each module as its own separate course. The grading methods, course structure, assignment weights, etc., will be set by the professor leading each module. Each module will be weighted exactly 50 percent. Your final grade will simply combine the two modules.

## Learning Outcomes

Journalism education associations have outlined two learning outcomes relevant to this class -- and your career. Students should know how to:

- apply basic numerical and statistical concepts
- apply current tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work

In this module, you will learn that and more. You will learn principles of visual communication that have grounded the liberal arts for centuries. You will learn basic essential journalism skills, such as reporting, finding information, storytelling and working with images and data. You will become familiar with the principles and practice that ground new, but always evolving, digital tools -- tools that will help you tell stories with data. You can decide if you want to specialize in one and this course can shape your career.

## Data: The hole in your resume

From Alberto Cairo, professor and author of <i>The Functional Art</i> and <i>The Truthful Art</i>:
- "I think that the future of visualization doesn't depend on the tools we use, but on solid principles."
- "Instead of thinking what the future of visualization will be, I perhaps should talk about what I want the future of news visualization to be."

Many of us go into journalism because we want to tell stories. Data are not stories -- we think.

In this class, we will find, however, that data is a way to find stories and data visualization is a way to tell stories.

Through data, we will look for patterns. We will see connections. We live in a time when large amounts of important data are available to us -- from university admission rates to poverty rates, from winning percentages to voting percentages. You will be less of a storyteller if you cannot take advantage of data. Others will be able to. You will have a hole in your resume.  

Then, once you see the story in the data, how will you tell the story? Sometimes words and pictures are perfect. Sometimes they are not enough. Sometimes you will want to arrange the data visually and create usable and beautiful pieces of information from columns of data. You should know how to do that. If not, you will have a hole in your resume.

Our graduates find work in journalism, media, communication, public relations, marketing, politics, law, health and many other fields. Every single field now wants its employees to understand data and data visualization. If you cannot, you will have a hole in your resume.

But no more.

## Readings
There are no required texts for this class. All readings, videos and tutorials will be found online.

## Grading
Your final grade for Jour 24 Visual Communication will be based on your performance in the two modules for the class, the traditional visual communication curriculum on photography, videography and print design and this new curriculum on data visualization. Each module will be weighted exactly 50 percent.

The data visualization module strives for a balance between principles and practice. So will our grading.

**20%** Quizzes, exams, annotations and analyses of readings and videos
- 50 questions total for module, .4 points each, 20 points
- Questions will be taken for each day from our [Concept Table](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/Concept%20Table%20Daily.md)

**50%** Assignments that put our principles into practice:
- 5 assignments at 10 points each: 50 points
  - infographic and comic journalism

## Lehigh Commitment to an Equitable Community

Lehigh University endorses The Principles of Our Equitable Community (http://www4.lehigh.edu/diversity/principles). We expect each member of this class to acknowledge and practice these Principles. Respect for each other and for differing viewpoints is a vital component of the learning environment inside and outside the classroom.
