# Day 6

## Telling Stories of Change Over Time, Part II

## The Line Chart (or Time Series Chart)

## Principles: Before Class

We will continue our exploration and work with the "two workhorses" of data visualization: the bar chart and the line chart.

## Practice: In Class
## Create Line Chart in Chartbuilder

We will next create and upload a time-based, line chartchart to GitHub and display it on your github.io pages.
- Here is a simple [Chartbuilder line chart](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/SVGtest.html) in svg format.
- Here is a simple [Chartbuilder line chart](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/PNGtest.html) in png format.

**Question: What are the percentages of students in each of Lehigh's three undergraduate colleges over the past ten years?**
- Find the data for ten years of Lehigh's [institutional profile](http://www.lehigh.edu/~oir/profiles/profile.htm). You will be using the html version that has more than ten years of Lehigh profiles in tabs at the bottom.
- Create a spreadsheet in Google docs that has four columns: Year, Arts & Sciences, Business and Engineering.
- Only collect the data for Arts & Sciences, Business and Engineering for the past ten years and enter it into a spreadsheet in Google Docs. This will take about 12 minutes.
- Copy that spreadsheet and create a line graph/time-series chart in Chartbuilder that shows the changes in percentage of undergraduate enrollment per college per year. 
- Download the chart from Charterbuilder, upload to name.github.io and place on your ReadMe page.

## Practice: Out of Class
## Graded Assignment
- Choose any data set that you would like that spans at least 10 years. You can find examples at our [Finding Data](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/Finding%20Data.md) page.
- Create a line chart tracking changes over time
- Consult our rubric to check your work
- Download and post to your GitHub site

### Getting more comfortable with html
- With the fear factor of coding now gone, let's look more closely at an html page:
- W3 Schools provides a [great introduction to html](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)

### Intro to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets in html)
- Open your first in-class infographic.html file in github.com (not your graded assignment)
- study the code once more
- Follow this straightforward [w3schools tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp). Scroll down to Inline CSS and use the simple instructions to change the font color of your heading to blue.
