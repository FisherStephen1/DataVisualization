## Practice

### Function and Form

- [The Functional Art/The Truthful Art](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/), Alberto Cairo: explore this site often
- **Finding Data**
  - I have set up a page, [Finding Data](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/Finding%20Data.md) to help you find data of interest to your projects, including local data for Lehigh University's Northampton County. Please feel free to find and share more.
- **Visualizing Data**
  - **Visualization Choices** for our class: infographics, timelines, charts, maps, storymaps and comics. Eventually we will add considerations of interactivity and mobile as well as documentaries
  - **Our Visualization Tools**: GitHub; Canva; TimelineJS; Chartbuilder; Google Fusion; Tableau, Pixton
  - **Best Practices**: [The Upshot](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/04/22/upshot/happy-birthday-upshot.html?_r=0), by The New York Times; [Wonkblog](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/), by the Washington Post; [Data Blog](http://www.theguardian.com/data), by the Guardian; [538](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), by Nate Silver; [Huffington Post Data](http://data.huffingtonpost.com/)

## Practice 
- **Getting Started with GitHub**
  -   Introduction to GitHub
  -   Show Inspect Source: right click on Macs -- Control click or touchpad tap
  -   Show difference between .md pages and html pages
  -   Register for and Set up GitHub.com. [Our Class GitHub.com Setup Instructions](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md)
  -   [Setting up GitHub: Hello, World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) with explanation of GitHub terms
  -   Or, more simply, Sign up for GitHub.com > Create new project/new repository > Initialize and create ReadMe (DataViz) page > Commit > begin to edit page
  -   Practice: [md Markdown basics](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
  -   [Another nice Markdown cheat sheet](http://assemble.io/docs/Cheatsheet-Markdown.html)
