# Day 7

## Telling Stories of Places

## The Map

## Principles: Before Class

Maps have been part of human understanding from our earliest days. It is likely that cave paintings and tree carvings from long ago were early maps. Maps allow us to see trends or patterns we might not otherwise see. 

With the advent of the mobile phone, people today expect geographic information on everything from traffic to restaurants. Recall that many classic and current examples of data visualizations are maps, such as John Snow's exploration of cholera in 1854 London to the work of data visualization journalists at the Washington Post today. We will learn how to tell stories with maps.


- [Best Practices in Maps, by CartoDB](http://docs.cartodb.com/tips-and-tricks/best-practices-checklist/), now CARTO; good, clear
- [ESRI Map Checklist](http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0911/making-a-map-meaningful.html), detailed narrative
- [So You Want To Make a Map...](https://github.com/veltman/learninglunches/tree/master/maps), by Noah Veltman, 2013, a nice intro to geodata terms and numbers (on GitHub)
- [Simple map exercise](https://github.com/cshirky/SimpleMapping/blob/master/Lesson1.md) from Clay Shirky on GitHub, showing xyz axis using Google maps. 
- Do a Google search: What are the coordinates for Lehigh University. Put the coordinates into a browser window. 

## Practice: In Class

## Before Leaving Charts
- With Chartbuilder, revise [Editor and Publisher Pie Chart](http://www.editorandpublisher.com/gallery/datapage/)

## New: Google NewsLab
- Google NewsLab has an [excellent tutorial](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-newslab.appspot.com/upload/Google_NewsLab_GoogleMyMaps.pdf) specifically designed for journalists

## Google Fusion Maps
- What is Google Fusion?
- Sample of student work: _[Sports Arenas in NY and NJ Area](https://madiwelker.github.io/madiwelker.github.io/sports.html)_ and _[Highest Rated Beer by State-](https://samtopp.github.io/)_
- Study Google spreadsheet and card system: [College Marching Bands](https://fusiontables.google.com/DataSource?docid=10AomOwjEjnXnFiYgzzQAbXknU3i15ORsSFW35HI#rows:id=1)
- Then do [Google Fusion map tutorial with image cards](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2527132?hl=en)
- **Some annotation needed** 
  - to begin, Google Drive now says "New", not "Create"; 
  - Fusion Tables is under More; 
  - we definitely will want to customize the cards to better design the info window; 
  - to change the style of the date to a more recognizable format, click on Date> Change> and change to Text: ie., May 24, 1941; 
  - To Publish to html: Go to Share and make map visible to public. Then click Tools > Publish > and get an iframe embed code.
- **If time**
  - [To customize icons on Google fusion map](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2679986?hl=en&ref_topic=2592806). It is too difficult to add or change icons on a map that already has been created. It is better to add to, edit or create new spread sheet with a new column: Icon. Perhaps just do that for 10 rows of the tutorial to save time.
