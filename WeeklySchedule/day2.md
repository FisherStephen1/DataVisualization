# Day 2
## Telling Stories with Data

## Principles: Before Class

- Retrace steps to your ReadMe page at github.com/name and introduce yourself so you get comfortable with writing in md
- Complete your github.com profile with photo and contact information
- View: [The Art of Data Visualization](http://www.pbs.org/video/2365039781/), PBS, (7:44)
- Read: [The Five Most Influential Visualizations of All Time](http://www.tableau.com/sites/default/files/whitepapers/the_5_most_influential_data_visualizations_of_all_time.pdf), 17 slides, from Tableau
- View: [Hans Gosling's Top 11 Ted Talk (2006)](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en) (19:46). A bit old but the energy is still high! It has 10.4 million views: "The best stats you've ever seen"
- Read: [Getting GitHub: Why journalists should know and use the social coding site](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2013/06/13/getting-github-why-journalists-should-know-and-use-the-social-coding-site/), a short essay by Emily Ferber (2013)

## Principles: In Class
- Review syllabus
- Discuss assignments: famous visualizations and videos
- Review Preattentive attributes: [Checklist](http://mediashift.org/2016/02/checklist-does-your-data-visualization-say-what-you-think-it-says/?utm_source=MediaShift+Daily&utm_campaign=59b3a6caad-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_70e55682fc-59b3a6caad-299977941), MediaShift essay by the editorial manager of Tableau
- Review [Data Visualization Checklist](http://stephanieevergreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DataVizChecklist_May2014.pdf), by Stephanie Evergreen and Ann Emery. We will agree on the main categories by which to judge our work. 
- Review our class [evaluation rubric](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/Grading%20Rubric.md)

## Practice 
- Create a GitHub portfolio site at github.io
- [Setting up GitHub hosting pages, github.io](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) This page was updated in 2017 and works well. If students have trouble, they can also see annotations at [class GitHub Setup Guide](https://github.com/HaiyanJia-Lehigh/DataVisualization/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md).
- Scroll down on that same [page guide](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) for instructions on **editing the code for themes**, such as **changing the page title**.
- Remembering that the page eventually will be their GitHub portfolio, students should customize their pages in md language. Directions To Customize the GitHub.io Page can be found at our [class GitHub Setup Guide](https://github.com/HaiyanJia-Lehigh/DataVisualization/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md). See GitHub portfolios from previous students for examples and inspiration.
- *Optional*: To further customize your GitHub page, see this [guide for customizing github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/customizing-github-pages/). For instance, you can [customize CSS and HTML in your Jekyll theme](https://help.github.com/articles/customizing-css-and-html-in-your-jekyll-theme/).
- To insert images (e.g., your profile picture) and/or links (e.g., links to your personal webpage, LinkedIn, social media pages, etc.), use markdown language as shown below. Note that you will need the url to the images (ending with jpeg, png, etc.) when inserting an image.

### Flowing Data
- [FlowingData](http://flowingdata.com/) is a great website and resource written by Nathan Yau, who also has some key books on working with data.
- Read a 44-page sample chapter, ["Representing Data"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B0fVXql3uCOpcXdONzBsUE1qcmc), taken from Yau's excellent book, Data Points
