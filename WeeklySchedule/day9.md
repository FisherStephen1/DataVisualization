# Day 9

## Telling Stories that Engage Readers

## Interactivity

Many of the best data visualizations do not just present information or tell stories. They allow readers/viewers to **interact** with the information, explore the data and create their own stories.

Creating interactive data visualizations was outside the skill set of many journalists and communication professionals, requiring more serious knowledge of coding and programming. Tableau is one of the tools created to solve that problem. It is not easy. But with a little work, anyone can start creating interactive data visualizations.

## Principles: Before Class
