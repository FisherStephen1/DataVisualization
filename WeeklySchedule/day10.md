# Day 10

## Telling Stories that Engage Readers
## Interactivity

We will continue learning the principles and practice of interactivity in data visualizations.

## Principles: Before Class

- View videos 9-15 in [Getting Started with Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources). Total time: 28:30 minutes.
- [The work of Ben Jones at Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/about/blog/contributors/ben-jones)
- Designing for Interactivity: [On the challenges of interative AND mobile](https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/how-the-wall-street-journal-approaches-data-interactives-on-mobile/s2/a574385/) by Elliot Bentley, of the Wall Street Journal

## Practice: In Class
- Use Tableau for "data exploration" -- [use a Sample Data Set, such as Titanic Names or Cat v Dog Popularity to explore maps and/or charts](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources)
- Follow our class [Tableau instructions](https://github.com/HaiyanJia-Lehigh/DataVisualization/blob/master/Tableau.md) and create an interactive visualization with the data; have at least two sheets and a Dashboard; if three sheets consider a Storypoint
- publish to your github.io page

## Practice: Out of Class
## Graded Assignment: Part 1
- Find a dataset that you are interested in. You will find links to many datasets at the [Finding Data](https://github.com/HaiyanJia-Lehigh/DataVisualization/blob/master/Finding%20Data.md) page of this DataViz Syllabus.
- Next week, we will begin to create an interactive visualization (chart or map) at Tableau. The visualization should have at least two sheets on a dashboard with title, short description, data source, image credit (if applicable), and your name.

## Resources
- Storypoints is an interesting development at Tableau. Videos 15 and 16 (about 11 minutes) provide an introduction at the [Resource page](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources)
- Also see [Tableau Storypoints](http://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/story-points?signin=17cf0d05edff756e4aae84b5425a2887)
- Example of [tab-like Storyboard feature of Tableau: European Football Spending](https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/spending-and-performance-5-european-football-leagues)
- Another example of [tab-like Storyboard on Tableau: Drug Poisoning](https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/fatal-drug-overdose-rates-united-states?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+VizOfTheDay+%28Viz+of+the+Day+-+Beautiful+Visual+Stories%29)

**Other examples of interactivity**
- 2016 Washington Post [interactive map on housing prices](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/wonk/housing/overview/?zip=#18015)
- [Migration Within the US](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/upshot/where-people-in-each-state-were-born.html?abt=0002&abg=0&_r=0), by the NY Times Upshot: Kevin Quealy
- [10 Data Journalists who use Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/s/blog/2016/02/10-data-journalists-follow-tableau-public?utm_campaign=Tableau%20Public%20Newsletter%20-%20GLOBAL%20en-US%20-%202016-03-08&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Eloqua&domain=gmail.com&eid=CTBLS000006197857#modal-signin)
- Other exercise: Download (or perhaps connect directly to Google Sheets from Tableau), this [data set on Ethnicity at Lehigh](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12NuHCygG7XaS4Nd0GHgStiEWUjXYpYXuC2Ru2ntLnWw/edit?usp=sharing)
